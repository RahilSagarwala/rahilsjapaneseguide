			<h2> Textbooks </h2>
			<img id=textbooks src=images/textbooks.jpg alt="Table of Japanese Textbooks">
			
			
			<p> 
			This is a helpful diagram of Japanese textbooks and workbooks that progress in level of difficulty. N5-N1 refers to the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test), where N5 is the easiest and N1 is the hardest. I personally have started with the Genki 1 textbook, workbook, and audio supplement as I had purchased them years ago. From what I have read, JFZ also does a great job. <br><br> What Genki does well, is its structural phases throughout a chapter. First comes a dialogue portion in which the student uses the included CD to read and listen to a conversation. Next comes the vocabulary which again is referred to by the CD audio such that it becomes easier to understand how to pronounce some words. There then may be a page or two dedicated towards cultural facts.  Next would come the grammar section which provides examples and explanations. The last section of every chapter involves verbal exercises that use the CD audio and integrates the vocabulary and grammar within the chapter. <br><br>One thing to note is that the first chapter is dedicated towards learning how to read the Japanese alphabet. The basic alphabet, Hiragana, consists of various sounds with one to two syllables. The next basic set of alphabet is known as Katakana which produces the exact same sounds as the Hiragana, however the shapes of the letters are different. This is based upon foreign words that have been adapted from various languages to Japanese. For instance, the word for America is A-me-ri-ka. In this case, Katakana is used. The Genki textbook is quite understanding towards the learning curve involved for some individuals and thus includes the English letters that make up the sounds (Romaji) in the vocabulary section. At around the fourth chapter, no English is included for the vocabulary. The last aspect of the Japanese alphabet is the Kanji which are symbols that have certain specific meanings and sounds. They consist of particular strokes that have their own meanings in order create combined meanings. There are thousands of them, however it is recommended to learn a specific 2000 or so of them. The Genki textbook includes Kanji in many locations, especially the vocabulary, however they are supplemented with the Hiragana or Katakana.

			<source src="audio/pimsleur.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" alt = "Pimsleur Sample">
			</audio> 

			
			<p> 
			When I first started, I wanted to not put so much pressure on myself and so I listened to 30 minutes of Pimsleur every night for about a week or two. It was great as a starting point to understand some of the most basic aspects of the language. Of course it does start to get more and more advanced, however I will find this to be lucrative later on in the studying process. One beneficial aspect of these audio lessons is that they build off of each other and tend to refer back to earlier lessons. In this way, it is pretty much unnecessary to listen to a 30 minute lesson again unless one feels he/she is not proficient in that area.

			<h2> Applications </h2>
			<a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/japanese?src=globalnav," target = "_blank"> Japanese (Kana & Kanji Reference)</a>
			<br>
			
			<img id=japaneseapp src=images/japaneseapp.png alt="Japanese App Icon">
			
			<p> 
			This is a handy app that has a nice table of all the Hiragana and Katakana. Along with this, there are about 2000 of the most important Kanji. What I like about this app is that upon clicking on any element, there is an automatic animation that shows how to write each symbol and in which direction. This goes for the Kanji as well which can get quite complicated in terms of stroke count.

			<br>
			
			<img id=kanawriting src=images/kanawriting.jpg alt="Kana Writing Icon">
			
			<p> 
			When it comes to writing the Hiragana and Katakana, it is a good idea to keep practicing especially if one's handwriting in general is not too great. This app allows the user to draw the symbols and toggle on/off the correct way to draw it.

			<br>
			
			<img id=ankiapp src=images/ankiapp.jpg alt="AnkiApp Icon">
			
			
			
			<p> 
			This is a flashcards app in which the user can search for any deck of cards or even make his/her own cards. Upon looking up Genki flashcards, I found a deck for each chapter and downloaded them. Where this app shines is its flexibility in terms of user configuartion. The user can edit the HTML/CSS aspect of the flashcards to decide on how images/text should be displayed. Another great aspect about this app is that the there is a progress bar next to each deck that gives the user a percentage of proficiency. The way that this app can calculate a percentage is from the scale of "fail", "hard", "good", or "easy" upon flipping a card.

			<p>
			I would highly recommend everyone to check this website out. Jisho is Japanese for dictionary and that is exactly what this website is. The user can type in any word or sentence in English or Japanese and  it will output the translation, any words that have different meanings, or possible synonyms.
