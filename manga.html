			It is always a good idea to supplement anime with manga in order to watch the anime without subtitles and understand the story at the same time. Another benefit to reading manga is that it can create excitment for the anime. There are also some manga that have not been released as an anime and therefore it could be lucrative to read that series. It is important to note that reading manga is different than reading comics in the West as manga is read from right to left.<br><br> Here is an example of a manga panel in Japanese and English for Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari (one of my current watching anime):
			</p>

			Here is an example of a manga panel in Japanese and English for Kimetsu no Yaiba, another anime I am currently watching:
			</p>
			<img id=kimetsumangajapanese src=images/kimetsumangajapanese.jpg alt = "Kimetsu no Yaiba Japanese Manga">
			<img id=kimetsumangaenglish src=images/kimetsumangaenglish.jpg alt = "Kimetsu no Yaiba English Manga">
			<br>
			<p>
			As you can see, the kanji characters in the Japanese panel have the Hiragana and Katakana next to them only in this manga. It would be wise to know which manga has these translations in order to be helpful for anyone who is not proficient in Kanji. Of course, easier manga may avoid Kanji altogether or include the Hiragana/Katakana next to them. 
			
			<h3> Helpful Resources </h3>
			<p>
			By having the tools necessary and watching the anime along with reading the manga, it is possible to create a meaningful plan in order to supplement one's studied. There may even be other resources available as well. One thing that I found is this YouTuber who made a few videos reading manga in Japanese and explaining it. Although she only has a few videos pertaining to this specific topic, this is just one example of a way in which more resources can be found:

			<br>
			
			<p>
			Another resource one can use is the <a id = boldwebsite href="https://bilingualmanga.com/" target = "_blank"> Bilingual Manga</a> website. This handy website allows the user to switch between English and Japanese while reading. This is similar to the <a id=boldwebsite href="https://animelon.com/" target = "_blank">Animelon</a> website which does pretty much the same thing for anime. I do find it to be easier for the user to swap languages while reading manga as it does not rquire having to pause the video player to catch up on the change of language.

			<h2>Apps</h2>
			
			<h3> <a href="https://www.cdisplayex.com target = "_blank">CDisplay Ex</a></h3>
			<p>
			This is the perfect app for the computer as it can handle all different types of files including PDF, CBR, or CBZ. One thing I like about this app is that the key bindings are fluid and work well. For instance, F12 is for sullscreen, - is to make the page smaller, and + is to make the page larger. There is also a toggle for manga mode which reverses the way in which the app flips through pages, the default being left to right. Another thing that I find myself using quite often is the double page toggle in which 2 pages are displayed at once.

			<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comic-zeal-comic-book-reader/id363990983?mt=8 target = "_blank">Comic Zeal</a> </h3>
			<p>
			I have had my difficulties in finding a good offline manga reader for the iPhone. This is the one I used many years ago and I have stuck with it. What I like about this is app is the importing aspect of files in which all one has to do is open up iTunes, navigate to the phone, then to file sharing, and then drag any file onto the Comic Zeal App. In the latest version of this app, importing should happen in the background without opening up the app. I however, do not have the latest version of the app. As I have the capability to downgrade apps, I decided that I wanted to downgrade to a version from a few years ago as some functions are broken in the current. One of the broken functions is landscape mode double tap to zoom in. Downgrading fixed this for me. This app also has the toggle for manga reading mode to reverse the way that pages change. One thing that other apps have done, but not this one, is the ability to scroll downwards to change the page. Although other apps have this feature, I still find myself not wanting to move away from Comic Zeal.
